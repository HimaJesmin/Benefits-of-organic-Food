	    	<h2>How your food is grown or raised can have a major impact on your mental and emotional health as well as the environment. Organic foods often have more beneficial nutrients, such as antioxidants, than their conventionally-grown counterparts and people with allergies to foods, chemicals, or preservatives may find their symptoms lessen or go away when they eat only <mark>organic foods </mark>.Organic produce contains fewer pesticides. Chemicals such as <mark> synthetic fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides </mark> are widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on (and in) the food we eat.Organic food is often fresher because it doesnâ€™t contain preservatives . that make it last longer. Organic produce is sometimes (but not always, so watch where it is from) produced on smaller farms nearer to where it is sold.</h2>

	    	<h3>Organic farming tends to be better for the environment. Organic farming practices may reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. Farming without synthetic pesticides is also better for nearby birds and animals as well as people who live close to farms.</h3>
	    	<h4>Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts. Feeding livestock animal byproducts increases the risk of mad cow disease (BSE) and <em>the use of antibiotics can create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria</em>. Organically-raised animals tend to be given more space to move around and access to the outdoors, which help to keep them healthy.</h4>

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) or genetically engineered (GE) foods are plants whose DNA has been altered in ways that cannot occur in nature or in traditional crossbreeding, most commonly in order to be resistant to pesticides or produce an insecticide.
